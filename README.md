## Project Overview

This project demonstrates how to scrape a Wikipedia page using Python. Specifically, we scrape the biography of **Rajneesh (Osho)** from his Wikipedia page.

### Features:
- Sends an HTTP request to Wikipedia and fetches the page content.
- Parses the HTML and extracts human-readable text from the biography section.
